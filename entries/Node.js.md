# Node.js



Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) code outside a web browser. 

Node.js lets developers use [JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) to write command line tools and for server-side scripting running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "[JavaScript](/wiki/JavaScript) everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.
